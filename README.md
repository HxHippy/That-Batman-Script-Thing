# That Batman Script Thing

A comic book adaptation of the infamous AI-generated Batman screenplay that went viral online.

You know the one. "Alltimes orphan." "Eat a dinner, Mattress Wayne." "I drink bats just like a bat would!"

## What Is This?

In 2023, an AI-generated Batman screenplay made the rounds on social media. It was
the funniest thing the internet had produced in years. Lines like "A clownly power"
and "Two-Face is a man but attorney" became instant classics.

This project takes that script and turns it into a proper comic book -- panel art
generated with Google Gemini, laid out as an HTML comic with speech bubbles and
narration boxes.

## The Original Script

The original AI-generated screenplay is included as `i0GrV4M.jpeg`. It circulated
widely online and its original author is unknown. If you know who created the
original prompt or script, please open an issue so we can give proper credit.

## Credits

- **Panel Art**: Generated with [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) image generation
